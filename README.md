This is a Quarto template for creating [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) presentations. It has minimal styling using the University of Sydney brand guidelines and is effective at presenting code, equations, and figures. A single `.qmd` source file can produce USYD-branded documents in HTML, PDF and MS Word formats. Supports publishing to Github Pages.

Note that these are not official templates, but they do follow the University of Sydney's branding guidelines.

If you use this template, you're expected to know how to use Quarto and the command line. If you're not familiar with Quarto, please see the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started.html) for more information.
